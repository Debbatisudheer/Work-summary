Work summary:
1. Security Cloud Control (SCC) â€“ Micro Frontend Application â€¢ Worked on Notification Micro Frontend (MFE) and UI Shell (Host) Application. â€¢ Integrated micro-frontend apps into the shell application and customized features per requirements. â€¢ Enhanced UI/UX using Cisco Magnetic Design System (pre-defined Cisco components). â€¢ Implemented state management, routing, shared libraries, and environment configurations. â€¢ Wrote tests with React Testing Library, used Storybook for component documentation, and configured webpack, loaders, babel. Key Topics Covered in React: Components, Props, State, Hooks, Context, HOCs, Routing, State Management, Fetch API, Providers, bundle.js, Source Maps, .env, .npmrc, Plugins Key Tech: React.js, Next.js, Storybook, Webpack, Cisco MDS, BootstrapProvider
2. Go WebSocket Client & Mock Server â€¢ Developed a Go WebSocket client for sending logs, telemetry, and security events to backend systems. â€¢ Built an Express.js mock server to simulate backend APIs, enabling testing and integration without needing the real backend. Key Tech: Go, WebSocket, Express.js, REST APIs
3. Tools Used â€¢ TablePlus â€“ Database management (view, query, update, backup MySQL/Postgres/MongoDB). â€¢ Postman â€“ API testing & automation. â€¢ JFrog Artifactory â€“ Artifact storage & distribution across environments. â€¢ Cisco Defense Orchestrator (CDO) â€“ Centralized cloud-based security management platform for firewalls & VPNs.
4. Event Collector (Syslog Parsing) â€¢ Enhanced the Event Collector repo by modifying Go code to use comma+space (, ) delimiter for syslog parsing instead of just comma. â€¢ Ensured key-value event parsing from network devices (firewalls, etc.) without breaking on extra commas. â€¢ Validated events via WebSocket client with JWT authentication and integrated events into the Cisco CDO portal. â€¢ Made multiple feature enhancements in Event Collector as per design requirements. Key Tech: Go, WebSocket, JWT, Syslog, CDO
5. Terraform â€“ Event Collector Infrastructure â€¢ Refactored Terraform deployment using modularization: o Split monolithic Terraform codebase into reusable modules (ALB, WAF, Splunk, Datadog, Infra, etc.). o Enabled independent deployments for each component â†’ faster, reusable, and scalable. â€¢ Improved maintainability, testing, and environment reusability (dev, staging, prod). Key Tech: Terraform, AWS (ALB, WAF, ECS, Infra), Splunk, Datadog
6. Jenkins Pipeline Automation â€¢ Designed a Jenkins pipeline to automate deployments with Terraform. â€¢ Pipeline Stages: o Prepare Environment â†’ AWS credentials, Terraform plugins, env vars. o Checkout Code â†’ Fetch commit/branch with Git. o Deploy Components â†’ Run https://createDeployment.py, update overrides.tf.json, trigger make plan/deploy. â€¢ Reduced deployment errors and enabled selective component deployments. Key Tech: Jenkins, Terraform, Python (createDeployment.py), Bash (.sh), Makefile
7. AWS ECS Task Checker â€¢ Built an AWS Lambda function to analyze recently stopped ECS tasks. â€¢ Detected task failures due to scaling/maintenance vs unexpected errors. â€¢ Triggered alerts (PagerDuty) for abnormal task stoppages. AWS Components Covered: EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3, CloudWatch, IAM, Secrets Manager, WAF
8. AI/ML â€“ ECS Task Failure Prediction â€¢ Proposed and implemented a proof-of-concept AI solution for early ECS task failure prediction. â€¢ Leveraged Amazon Lookout for Metrics with CloudWatch logs + ECS metrics for anomaly detection. â€¢ Enabled proactive alerting and reduced ECS downtime. Key Tech: AWS Lookout for Metrics, S3, CloudWatch, ECS, AI/ML anomaly detection
9. Additional Tools & Integrations â€¢ Docker â€“ Containerization of services. â€¢ Splunk & Datadog â€“ Event monitoring, telemetry, observability.
